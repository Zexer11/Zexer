# Zexer

## Overview

Zexer is a mobile application developed to streamline the shopping experience. The app allows buyers to scan their own items immediately upon picking them from the shelf. Once scanned, the app generates a shopping receipt, enabling users to directly pay through the app. This functionality aims to reduce congestion at the cashier area, making the shopping process faster and more efficient.

- **Receipt Generation:** Automatic generation of shopping receipts based on scanned items.
- **Direct Payment:** Pay directly through the app, bypassing the cashier.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for users.
- **Manage Account:** Update personal information and payment methods.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** For application logic.
- **XML:** For defining UI layouts.
- **Android Studio:** Integrated development environment.
- **Firebase:** (Planned) For user authentication and database management.

## Current Status

This project is a work in progress. The basic functionality is implemented, but there are many features and improvements that need to be added.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved UI/UX:** Make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **Enhanced Security:** Implement robust security measures for payment processing.
- **Inventory Management:** Allow stores to manage their inventory through the app.
- **Integration with Store Systems:** Seamless integration with existing store POS systems.
